Cold Run

Cold Run is a web-based application that determines the appropriate running gear based on the user’s weather conditions. 
As a person who struggles to stay motivated to workout, I created this application to help me continue my outdoor workout 
routine. I realized that when I looked at the current temperature and saw anything below 30 degrees, I promptly determined 
it was too cold to run outside. Or if I did brave the cold temperatures, in 5 minutes I was either too hot or chilled 
to the bone. I created this app to make it easy to determine what to wear without having to see the temperature to get 
discouraged. My hope is that others will use this application to continue to stay motivated in their exercise plans.

The technologies that I used include HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Maps Geolocation API, 
Open Weather API and eBay's API. Users can click the button “Get Running” which will activate the Google Maps 
Geolocation API to determine their location. Based on this result, weather conditions are determined and clothing 
recommendations are displayed based on the 3-day forecast. Additionally, the header image is changed to reflect the 
current weather conditions. Lastly, there are gear suggestions for cold weather workouts.
